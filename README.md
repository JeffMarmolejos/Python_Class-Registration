# Python_Class-Registration

A student class registration system created using Python. The system consists of 5 functions in 2 modules. The program asks the student to login using their ID and Pin or exit the program. The program checks to see if the ID and PIN matches any of the student ID and PINs in the student list. From there, students can add preselected courses, drop courses, view their current courses, or log out of their registration. After logging out, the program asks again for student ID and gives the option to exit the program.
